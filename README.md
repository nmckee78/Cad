## Cad_Skateboard

### Description 
The Skateboard was our first Cad assignment and was simply to design a skateboard.
### Evidence

### Reflection
The skateboard was basically assembled in two and a half stages first assembling the deck and the trucks in one part assembley and then in another one assembling the wheels due to the different geometry. Then, you put it all together in the assembley which is much easier than trying to do it all in one part studio. While this assignment was much easier then the swing arm due to us having a guide and a simpler task it still provided some diffuclty for me espically in getting the trucks to add onto the bottom of the board but I eventually figured it out with some help as I wasn't making the extrude a new part and so it was thinking it was still part of the board making it now work. But once I got over that hurdle I cruised through the rest of the project.
